Part 1: 
-Front-facing camera to identify humans when dog is racing towards them.
-The camera can also perform facial recognition to identify dog owners and close friends that the dog would not harm.

Part 2:
-Non invasive EEG device that accurately measures the dog's level of aggressiveness.
-When the dog has a high level of agressiveness and is running towards an unrecognized human being, it can be stunned through a portable device to prevent unprovoked injury.
